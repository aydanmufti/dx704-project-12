Discussed assignment with: No one

Libraries used:
- pandas: For data manipulation and reading/writing CSV/TSV files
- numpy: For numerical operations and array manipulations
- torch: For running BERT model computations
- transformers: For loading and using pre-trained BERT model from Hugging Face
- sklearn.linear_model: For training linear regression model
- json: For encoding embedding vectors as JSON
- tqdm: For progress bars during processing

Additional resources:
I used the lecture materials provided in the course. I refered to Piaza for understanding the file size and rounding solutions. I also referenced the Hugging Face documentation for the BERT model implementation and for the API key and how to use it in Google Colab.
